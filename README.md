# Fullstack Practice Collection

This repository contains a collection of hands-on exercises, practice projects, and mini applications completed during Mission Ready HQ Level 4 and Level 5 training.  
These projects represent my learning journey across **JavaScript fundamentals**, **DOM manipulation**, **React**, **cloud deployment**, and **fullstack development basics**.

This repo is designed to keep small practice projects organised in one place, while my main fullstack projects are presented in separate repositories.
